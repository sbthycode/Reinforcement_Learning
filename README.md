# Reinforcement_Learning
The taxi, initially coloured yellow spawns randomly at a location in the map. It collects the passenger from one of the (R,G,Y and B) loccations. Thus the colour of the taxi turns green. It drops of th passenger to he destination highlighted in magenta.
I have used Q-learning with a Q-table of size 500X6 as the state size is 500 and the action has a space of 6. The details can be seen from the problem_description.
